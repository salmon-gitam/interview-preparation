1. **What is the difference between a Stack and a Queue?**  
   **Answer:**  
   A *stack* is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the most recently added element is the first to be removed. Typical operations include push (insert), pop (remove), and peek (view the top element).  
   In contrast, a *queue* follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first to be removed. It supports operations like enqueue (insert) and dequeue (remove).  
   **Example:**  
   Consider a browser’s history (stack) versus a print queue (queue).  
   **Time Complexity:**  
   For both structures, insertion and removal are typically O(1).

---

2. **How do Arrays differ from Linked Lists?**  
   **Answer:**  
   An *array* is a contiguous block of memory with fixed size and constant-time (O(1)) access to any element using an index. However, insertion and deletion (except at the end) require shifting elements and are O(n).  
   A *linked list* consists of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. It allows efficient insertions and deletions (O(1) if the pointer is known), but accessing an element is O(n) due to sequential traversal.  
   **Use Cases:**  
   Arrays are best when random access is required; linked lists are useful when frequent insertions/deletions occur.

---

3. **Explain Recursion. What are its Advantages and Disadvantages?**  
   **Answer:**  
   *Recursion* is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.  
   **Example:** Calculating the factorial of n:  
   ```c
   int factorial(int n) {
       if (n <= 1) return 1;
       return n * factorial(n - 1);
   }
   ```  
   **Advantages:**  
   - Code can be simpler and more readable.  
   - Naturally fits problems with divide-and-conquer or hierarchical structures.  
   **Disadvantages:**  
   - May lead to high space usage (call stack growth) and potential stack overflow.  
   - Sometimes less efficient than iterative solutions.

---

4. **What is Dynamic Programming (DP) and how does it differ from Divide and Conquer?**  
   **Answer:**  
   DP is an optimization technique used for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. It stores solutions to subproblems (using memoization or tabulation) to avoid redundant computations.  
   In contrast, Divide and Conquer breaks the problem into independent subproblems and then combines the solutions, without storing subproblem results.  
   **Example:**  
   The Fibonacci sequence can be computed recursively (divide and conquer) but is inefficient due to repeated calls. DP improves this by storing computed values.  
   **Time Complexity:**  
   DP for Fibonacci runs in O(n), compared to O(2ⁿ) in naive recursion.

---

5. **What are Greedy Algorithms? When are they effective and when might they fail?**  
   **Answer:**  
   Greedy algorithms make the best local choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.  
   **Effective Examples:**  
   - *Activity Selection:* Choosing the next activity with the earliest finish time yields an optimal solution.  
   - *Huffman Coding:* Builds an optimal prefix code for data compression.  
   **When They Might Fail:**  
   - In problems like the coin change (with non-canonical coin systems) or the traveling salesman problem, a greedy choice does not always lead to an optimal solution.

---

6. **How do you analyze an algorithm’s Time Complexity and Space Complexity?**  
   **Answer:**  
   *Time complexity* measures how the runtime increases with input size (using Big-O notation, e.g., O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)).  
   *Space complexity* assesses the extra memory required.  
   **Example:**  
   Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and space complexity of O(n) due to auxiliary arrays.  
   These analyses help choose the most efficient algorithm based on input size and available resources.

---

7. **What is a Hash Table and how does it resolve collisions?**  
   **Answer:**  
   A *hash table* stores key–value pairs and uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets.  
   **Collision Resolution Techniques:**  
   - *Chaining:* Each bucket stores a list of items that hash to the same index.  
   - *Open Addressing:* Uses probing (linear, quadratic, or double hashing) to find an open slot.  
   **Time Complexity:**  
   Average-case operations are O(1), though worst-case can be O(n) if many collisions occur.

---

8. **What are the Four Main Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**  
   **Answer:**  
   The four key principles are:  
   - *Encapsulation:* Bundling data with methods that operate on that data, hiding internal details.  
   - *Inheritance:* Deriving new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse.  
   - *Polymorphism:* Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, with methods behaving differently based on the actual object type (e.g., function overriding).  
   - *Abstraction:* Hiding complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts.  
   **Example:**  
   In C++ or Java, a class `Animal` can be the base class with derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` that override a method `speak()`.

---

9. **How does Procedural Programming differ from Object-Oriented Programming?**  
   **Answer:**  
   *Procedural programming* (e.g., in C) focuses on functions and sequential steps to manipulate data, whereas *OOP* organizes code into objects that combine data and behavior.  
   **Differences:**  
   - Procedural code is organized around functions and procedures; OOP emphasizes classes and objects.  
   - OOP provides features like inheritance and polymorphism, facilitating code reuse and modularity.  
   **When to Use:**  
   Use procedural programming for simple, linear tasks and OOP for complex systems with interacting entities.

---

10. **Differentiate between Pass-by-Value and Pass-by-Reference.**  
    **Answer:**  
    In *pass-by-value*, a copy of the variable is passed to a function. Modifications in the function do not affect the original variable.  
    In *pass-by-reference*, the function receives a reference (or pointer) to the original variable, so changes affect the original.  
    **Example in C:**  
    To simulate pass-by-reference, you can pass the address of a variable:  
    ```c
    void increment(int *num) {
        (*num)++;
    }
    int main() {
        int a = 5;
        increment(&a);
        // a becomes 6
    }
    ```

---

11. **What is a Memory Leak and How Can It Be Prevented?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A *memory leak* occurs when allocated memory is not properly deallocated, causing the program to consume more memory over time.  
    **Prevention:**  
    - Always pair every `malloc`/`calloc` with a corresponding `free`.  
    - Use tools such as Valgrind to detect leaks during testing.  
    **Example:**  
    If you allocate an array with `malloc` and lose its pointer without freeing it, that memory remains allocated until the program ends.

---

12. **What is Multithreading and What are Common Issues in Multithreaded Programs?**  
    **Answer:**  
    *Multithreading* allows concurrent execution of parts of a program (threads) within a process, which can improve performance on multicore systems.  
    **Common Issues:**  
    - *Race Conditions:* Multiple threads accessing shared data concurrently can lead to inconsistent results.  
    - *Deadlocks:* Two or more threads waiting indefinitely for resources held by each other.  
    - *Synchronization Overhead:* Excessive locking can diminish performance.  
    **Example:**  
    Using mutexes or semaphores can help control access to shared resources.

---

13. **What is a Deadlock and How Can It Be Avoided?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A *deadlock* occurs when two or more threads are waiting indefinitely for resources locked by each other, resulting in a standstill.  
    **Avoidance Strategies:**  
    - Ensure a consistent locking order.  
    - Use timeout mechanisms for acquiring locks.  
    - Employ deadlock detection algorithms.  
    **Example:**  
    In a banking application, if two transactions wait for each other’s locks on accounts, proper ordering or lock timeouts can prevent deadlocks.

---

14. **What is the Difference Between a Process and a Thread?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A *process* is an independent program with its own memory space, while a *thread* is a lightweight unit of execution within a process that shares the process’s resources.  
    **Differences:**  
    - Processes are isolated; threads within the same process share data and memory.  
    - Creating a new thread is typically faster and uses less overhead compared to creating a new process.  
    **Example:**  
    In a web server, each request might be handled by a separate thread within a single process.

---

15. **What is a Binary Search Tree (BST) and How Do Balanced BSTs Differ?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A *BST* is a tree data structure where each node has a key greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than those in its right subtree, enabling efficient searches (average O(log n)).  
    *Balanced BSTs* (like AVL or Red-Black trees) ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced so that worst-case operations remain O(log n).  
    **Example:**  
    Inserting keys in sorted order into an unbalanced BST results in a degenerate (linked list–like) structure, while AVL trees automatically rebalance.

---

16. **Compare Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort in Terms of Complexity and Use Cases.**  
    **Answer:**  
    - *Merge Sort:*  
      - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) worst-case.  
      - **Space Complexity:** O(n) auxiliary space.  
      - **Stability:** Stable.  
      - **Use Case:** Preferred when stable sort is required, especially for linked lists.  
    - *Quick Sort:*  
      - **Time Complexity:** Average-case O(n log n), worst-case O(n²) (mitigated with random pivots).  
      - **Space Complexity:** O(log n) recursion stack on average.  
      - **Stability:** Not stable (unless modified).  
      - **Use Case:** Often the fastest in practice for arrays.  
    - *Bubble Sort:*  
      - **Time Complexity:** O(n²) worst-case.  
      - **Space Complexity:** O(1).  
      - **Stability:** Stable.  
      - **Use Case:** Educational purposes; rarely used in production due to inefficiency.

---

17. **Explain Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Graph Traversal.**  
    **Answer:**  
    *DFS* explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking, using recursion or a stack, and is useful for path-finding and cycle detection. Its time complexity is O(V + E).  
    *BFS* visits all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level, using a queue, and is optimal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. Its time complexity is also O(V + E).  
    **Example:**  
    Use DFS to detect cycles in a directed graph and BFS to find the shortest path in a maze.

---

18. **What is Memoization in Dynamic Programming?**  
    **Answer:**  
    *Memoization* is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.  
    **Example:**  
    When calculating Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing previously computed values avoids redundant calculations, reducing the time complexity from exponential to linear.

---

19. **What Are Design Patterns and Give an Example of the Singleton Pattern?**  
    **Answer:**  
    *Design patterns* are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. The *Singleton pattern* ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.  
    **Example:**  
    In a logging system, using a Singleton ensures that all parts of the application use the same logger instance. In C++ or Java, the Singleton is implemented by making the constructor private and providing a static method that returns the instance.

---

20. **What is Big-O Notation and Why Is It Important?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Big-O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements as a function of the input size. It is crucial for comparing algorithm efficiency and scalability.  
    **Example:**  
    An algorithm with O(n log n) complexity (like merge sort) scales much better than one with O(n²) (like bubble sort) as n increases.

---

21. **What is the Difference Between Compilation and Interpretation?**  
    **Answer:**  
    *Compilation* translates the entire source code into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++), resulting in faster runtime execution but requiring a separate compilation step.  
    *Interpretation* translates and executes code line-by-line at runtime (e.g., Python, JavaScript), which makes debugging easier but may result in slower execution.  
    **Example:**  
    C code is compiled into an executable file, whereas a Python script is run by an interpreter.

---

22. **When Should You Use a Trie (Prefix Tree) and What Are Its Advantages?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A *Trie* is ideal for problems involving dynamic string storage and retrieval, such as autocomplete systems or spell-checkers.  
    **Advantages:**  
    - Fast lookup, insertion, and deletion (O(m) time, where m is the key length).  
    - Efficient in terms of prefix search and dictionary implementations.  
    **Example:**  
    In an auto-suggest feature, a Trie can quickly retrieve all words that start with a given prefix.

---

23. **What is Fast Exponentiation and Why Is It Useful?**  
    **Answer:**  
    *Fast exponentiation* (or binary exponentiation) computes \(x^n\) in O(log n) time by repeatedly squaring the base and reducing the exponent.  
    **Use Case:**  
    It is particularly useful in modular arithmetic for cryptographic algorithms.  
    **Example:**  
    Calculating \(2^{10}\) by squaring: \(2^{10} = 2^8 \times 2^2\), computed efficiently rather than multiplying 2 ten times.

---

24. **What is Bit Manipulation and Can You Give an Example?**  
    **Answer:**  
    *Bit manipulation* involves using bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts) to perform operations at the bit level. It is used for performance optimization, setting flags, and low-level programming.  
    **Example:**  
    Counting set bits in an integer using Brian Kernighan’s algorithm operates in O(number of set bits) time.  
    ```c
    int countSetBits(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n) {
            n &= (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
    ```

---

25. **Where and How Would You Use the Two-Pointer and Sliding Window Techniques?**  
    **Answer:**  
    The *two-pointer technique* is effective in sorted arrays or lists when searching for pairs or processing subsequences (e.g., finding two numbers that sum to a target).  
    The *sliding window algorithm* is used for problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings, such as finding the maximum sum subarray of fixed length or the longest substring without repeating characters.  
    **Example:**  
    - Two-pointer: Given a sorted array, use one pointer at the start and one at the end to find a pair that sums to a target.  
    - Sliding window: To compute the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k, maintain the sum of the current window and slide it across the array.  
    **Time Complexity:**  
    Both techniques can achieve O(n) time complexity, making them efficient for large datasets.

---

26. **What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in C?**  
   **Answer:**  
   A *shallow copy* duplicates only the top-level structure, copying pointer values but not the data they reference. This means both the original and copy share the same dynamically allocated memory. A *deep copy* duplicates not only the structure but also recursively copies the memory pointed to, ensuring complete independence between the copies.  
   **Example:**  
   For a structure containing a pointer to a dynamically allocated array, a shallow copy copies the pointer (both point to the same array), whereas a deep copy allocates new memory and copies each element.  
   **Usage Consideration:**  
   Use deep copies when modifications to one copy must not affect the other.

---

27. **Explain tail recursion and its optimization.**  
   **Answer:**  
   *Tail recursion* occurs when a recursive function’s final action is a call to itself. This allows some compilers to optimize the recursion by reusing the same stack frame (tail-call optimization), converting recursion into iteration under the hood.  
   **Example:**  
   A tail-recursive factorial function passes an accumulator parameter:
   ```c
   int tailFactorial(int n, int acc) {
       if (n == 0)
           return acc;
       return tailFactorial(n - 1, n * acc);
   }
   // Usage: tailFactorial(5, 1) computes 5!
   ```
   **Benefit:**  
   Reduces call stack usage, preventing stack overflow for large n.

---

28. **What are function pointers and how are they used in C?**  
   **Answer:**  
   A *function pointer* stores the address of a function. They allow dynamic selection of functions to call, enabling callback mechanisms, implementing polymorphic behavior, and designing flexible APIs.  
   **Example:**  
   ```c
   int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
   int subtract(int a, int b) { return a - b; }

   int main() {
       int (*op)(int, int);
       op = add;  // Assign function pointer to add
       printf("Result: %d\n", op(5, 3));  // Calls add(5, 3)
       op = subtract;
       printf("Result: %d\n", op(5, 3));  // Calls subtract(5, 3)
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   **Usage Note:**  
   Function pointers are critical in event-driven programming and designing libraries.

---

29. **Explain the differences between stack and heap memory allocation.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Stack:**  
     - Memory is allocated automatically when a function is called.  
     - Fast allocation/deallocation.  
     - Limited in size; managed by the system.  
     - Local variables and function call information are stored here.  
   - **Heap:**  
     - Memory is allocated dynamically using functions like `malloc`/`calloc`.  
     - Slower allocation; must be explicitly deallocated with `free`.  
     - Much larger space available but prone to fragmentation.  
   **Example:**  
   Local variable `int a;` is on the stack; `int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));` is on the heap.

---

30. **What is a segmentation fault, and what are common causes?**  
   **Answer:**  
   A *segmentation fault* is a runtime error caused by accessing memory that “does not belong” to the process. Common causes include:  
   - Dereferencing a NULL or uninitialized pointer.  
   - Accessing memory beyond array boundaries.  
   - Writing to read-only memory.  
   **Example:**  
   ```c
   int *p = NULL;
   *p = 5;  // Causes segmentation fault because p is NULL.
   ```
   **Prevention:**  
   Use proper pointer initialization, bounds checking, and memory management.

---

31. **What is pointer decay in C?**  
   **Answer:**  
   *Pointer decay* refers to the automatic conversion of an array name to a pointer to its first element when passed to a function. This means the size information is lost.  
   **Example:**  
   ```c
   void printArray(int *arr, int n) { /* ... */ }
   int nums[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   printArray(nums, 5);  // 'nums' decays to pointer to its first element.
   ```
   **Consideration:**  
   If size information is needed, pass the array length explicitly.

---

32. **Explain the role of the linker and loader in the C build process.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Linker:** Combines object files generated by the compiler into a single executable, resolving symbol references between files.  
   - **Loader:** Loads the executable into memory and prepares it for execution, resolving addresses for dynamic libraries if necessary.  
   **Example:**  
   In a multi-file project, the linker binds calls to functions defined in different object files.
   **Importance:**  
   Understanding these helps diagnose issues like unresolved symbols or dynamic library problems.

---

33. **What are compile-time versus runtime errors in C?**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Compile-time errors:**  
     - Detected by the compiler (syntax errors, type mismatches, undeclared variables).  
     - Must be fixed before the program can be compiled successfully.  
   - **Runtime errors:**  
     - Occur during program execution (segmentation faults, division by zero, logic errors).  
     - Often harder to debug because they depend on the program’s state and input.  
   **Example:**  
   A missing semicolon is a compile-time error; dereferencing a NULL pointer is a runtime error.

---

34. **How do inline functions differ from macros in C?**  
   **Answer:**  
   *Inline functions* are actual functions with a suggestion to the compiler to embed the code at the call site, preserving type safety and debuggability. Macros are preprocessor substitutions that perform text replacement without type checking.  
   **Example:**  
   ```c
   inline int square(int x) { return x * x; }
   #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
   ```
   **Advantage of inline functions:**  
   They avoid pitfalls of macros (e.g., double evaluation, operator precedence issues).

---

35. **What are some pitfalls of using macros in C and how can they be avoided?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Common pitfalls include:  
    - **Lack of type checking:** Macros are mere text substitutions.  
    - **Multiple evaluations:** Macros may evaluate arguments more than once, causing side effects.  
    - **Operator precedence issues:** Without careful parenthesization, macros can lead to unexpected results.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    #define SQUARE(x) x * x
    // SQUARE(1+2) expands to 1+2*1+2 which is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5, not 9.
    ```
    **Solution:**  
    Use inline functions when possible or carefully parenthesize macros:
    ```c
    #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
    ```

---

36. **What is a union and how does it differ from a struct?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A *union* allows storing different data types in the same memory location; all members share the same memory. A *struct* allocates separate memory for each member.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    union Data {
        int i;
        float f;
        char str[20];
    };
    struct DataStruct {
        int i;
        float f;
        char str[20];
    };
    ```
    **Usage:**  
    Unions are useful when you want a variable to hold one of several types (saving space), while structs are used to group related data.

---

37. **What is a circular buffer and how can you implement one in C?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A *circular buffer* is a fixed-size buffer that wraps around when the end is reached, effectively reusing storage. It is useful in streaming data or implementing queues.  
    **Key Concepts:**  
    - Two indices (head and tail) manage insertion and removal.  
    - When head or tail reaches the buffer’s end, it wraps to the beginning.  
    **Implementation:**  
    You maintain an array, and update indices modulo the buffer size.  
    **Example (pseudo-code):**  
    ```c
    #define SIZE 5
    int buffer[SIZE];
    int head = 0, tail = 0;
    // To enqueue: buffer[tail] = value; tail = (tail + 1) % SIZE;
    // To dequeue: value = buffer[head]; head = (head + 1) % SIZE;
    ```

---

38. **Explain the use of the const qualifier in pointer declarations.**  
    **Answer:**  
    The `const` qualifier can be applied in different ways to pointers:  
    - *Pointer to const data:* The data pointed to cannot be modified through the pointer.  
      ```c
      const int *ptr;
      ```
    - *Const pointer:* The pointer itself cannot be changed to point to a different address.
      ```c
      int *const ptr;
      ```
    - *Const pointer to const data:* Neither the pointer nor the data it points to can be modified.  
      ```c
      const int *const ptr;
      ```
    **Usage:**  
    Use `const` to enforce immutability where appropriate, making your code safer and easier to understand.

---

39. **What is a memory pool and how can it be implemented in C?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A *memory pool* is a pre-allocated block of memory from which smaller chunks are allocated on demand. This can reduce overhead from repeated allocations and deallocations.  
    **Implementation Ideas:**  
    - Allocate a large block using `malloc` and manage free blocks manually.  
    - Maintain a free list of available memory chunks.  
    **Use Case:**  
    Useful in systems with frequent allocations of similarly sized objects, such as in embedded systems or game engines.

---

40. **Describe the use of setjmp and longjmp for error handling in C.**  
    **Answer:**  
    `setjmp` and `longjmp` allow non-local jumps in C, similar to exception handling in higher-level languages.  
    **Usage:**  
    - `setjmp(jmp_buf env)` saves the current environment (stack context).  
    - `longjmp(env, val)` jumps back to the saved environment, effectively unwinding the stack.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    #include <setjmp.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    jmp_buf buf;
    void errorHandler() {
        longjmp(buf, 1);
    }

    int main() {
        if (setjmp(buf)) {
            printf("Error occurred, recovered using longjmp.\n");
        } else {
            // Code that may call errorHandler()
            errorHandler();
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    **Note:**  
    Use with care, as it bypasses normal function return mechanisms.

---

41. **What are some common debugging techniques in C, and how do you use them?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Common techniques include:  
    - **Using gdb:** The GNU Debugger allows stepping through code, inspecting variables, and setting breakpoints.  
    - **Valgrind:** Detects memory leaks and invalid memory accesses.  
    - **Logging and assertions:** Using `printf` statements and `assert` to verify assumptions.  
    **Example:**  
    Insert `assert(ptr != NULL);` after dynamic allocations to catch errors early.

42. **Explain pointer arithmetic and its common pitfalls.**  
    **Answer:**  
    Pointer arithmetic lets you move through contiguous memory locations. For example, adding 1 to an `int*` pointer advances it by the size of an `int`.  
    **Pitfalls:**  
    - Miscalculating offsets when array bounds aren’t respected.  
    - Undefined behavior when moving a pointer beyond the allocated memory.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    int arr[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    int *p = arr;
    p++;  // Now points to arr[1]
    ```
    **Advice:**  
    Always ensure pointer arithmetic remains within valid memory bounds.

43. **How do you prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities in C?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Buffer overflows occur when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold. Prevention strategies include:  
    - Using functions that limit the number of characters read (e.g., `fgets` instead of `gets`).  
    - Checking array bounds manually.  
    - Using modern tools and libraries that enforce bounds checking.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    char buffer[10];
    // Instead of gets(buffer);
    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
    ```
    **Best Practice:**  
    Always validate input sizes and use secure functions.

44. **What is the role of the volatile keyword in embedded systems programming in C?**  
    **Answer:**  
    The `volatile` qualifier tells the compiler that a variable’s value may change at any time—without any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby. This prevents the compiler from applying certain optimizations that assume variables do not change unexpectedly.  
    **Example:**  
    In embedded systems, hardware registers or variables modified by an interrupt service routine are declared volatile:
    ```c
    volatile int sensorValue;
    ```
    **Benefit:**  
    Ensures that every read and write occurs as specified, which is critical for hardware interaction.

45. **Compare static linking versus dynamic linking.**  
    **Answer:**  
    - **Static Linking:**  
      - All libraries are embedded into the final executable at compile time.  
      - Results in a larger executable, but the program does not depend on external libraries at runtime.  
    - **Dynamic Linking:**  
      - Libraries are linked at runtime, keeping the executable smaller.  
      - Offers easier updates (shared libraries can be updated independently) but requires the libraries to be present on the system.  
    **Trade-offs:**  
    Static linking offers portability at the cost of size, while dynamic linking provides modularity and memory savings if multiple programs share libraries.

46. **What is a function prototype and why is it important in C?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A function prototype declares a function’s signature (its return type and parameters) before its use. This allows the compiler to check that functions are called with the correct arguments, ensuring type safety.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    // Prototype declaration
    int add(int, int);

    int main() {
        int result = add(3, 4);
        return 0;
    }
    // Function definition
    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    ```
    **Importance:**  
    Prevents errors from mismatched types and allows functions to be used before their definitions appear.

47. **How do you implement a simple dynamic array in C?**  
    **Answer:**  
    A dynamic array is an array that can grow or shrink at runtime. Typically, you start with an initial allocation using `malloc` and then use `realloc` to change the size as needed.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    int *arr = malloc(initial_size * sizeof(int));
    // To resize:
    arr = realloc(arr, new_size * sizeof(int));
    ```
    **Considerations:**  
    Always check for allocation failures and remember to free the memory when done.

48. **Discuss recursion versus iteration and their trade-offs.**  
    **Answer:**  
    Both techniques can solve repetitive tasks:  
    - **Recursion:**  
      - Often yields clearer, more concise code for problems with natural recursive structure (e.g., tree traversals, divide and conquer).  
      - May lead to high memory usage and risk stack overflow if not tail-optimized.  
    - **Iteration:**  
      - Generally uses less memory since it avoids deep call stacks.  
      - May require more complex loop constructs and can be less intuitive for naturally recursive problems.
    **Example:**  
    Computing Fibonacci numbers recursively (without memoization) has exponential time, while an iterative loop runs in linear time.

49. **How does C handle type promotion in expressions?**  
    **Answer:**  
    When different data types are used in an expression, C automatically promotes the types to a common type to perform the operation. For example, in an expression involving an `int` and a `float`, the `int` is promoted to a `float`.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    int a = 5;
    float b = 2.3;
    float result = a + b;  // 'a' is promoted to float
    ```
    **Pitfall:**  
    Implicit promotions can sometimes lead to loss of precision, so explicit casts may be necessary.

50. **What are variadic functions and how are they implemented in C?**  
    **Answer:**  
    Variadic functions accept a variable number of arguments. They are declared with an ellipsis (`...`) in the parameter list and use macros from `<stdarg.h>` to access the arguments.  
    **Example:**  
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdarg.h>

    // Variadic function to compute the sum of n integers.
    int sum(int count, ...) {
        va_list args;
        va_start(args, count);
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
            total += va_arg(args, int);
        va_end(args);
        return total;
    }

    int main() {
        printf("Sum: %d\n", sum(4, 10, 20, 30, 40));
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    **Usage:**  
    Variadic functions are useful for functions like `printf` that need to accept a flexible number of arguments.
